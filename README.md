## About the mod

The mod adds a slime called the **"Glue Slime"**, its made out of glue and some slimey substance. Its model uses the Puddle Slime model, but it will not evaporate or anything like that. It is a vegetarian, if there is no other food sources.. it may result to eating Pink Slimes to satisfy its hunger. They produce Glue Plorts which have a good amount of value, but not as high as the gold plorts.

## Special Thanks

Slime Rancher was an amazing game to mod, and I'm glad I did it! The Glue Slime is my first mod.. and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! Also, Glue Slimes spawn anywhere on the game.. but with a **8% chance** (probably?) of spawning. That's pretty common though, so you'll probably most likely see it somewhere around there!
